# Andrew Pryde's dotfiles

A not particularly well thought through collection of dotfiles.

## Tools of the trade

 - [vim][4]
 - [tmux][3]
 - [zsh][1]
 - [zplug][2]
 - [`rcm`][7]

## Installation

 1. Install [`rcm`][7]
 2. `env RCRC=$HOME/.dotfiles/rcrc rcup`

### Mac OS X

 - Install homebrew:
   `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
 - Install pip https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

## TODO

 - OL BASE
 - OL 7 -> 8
 - Ubuntu <-> livepatch <-kernal ?

## Inspiration / plagiarism

As with dotfiles everywhere I've begged, borrowed, and stolen snippets from too
many places to provide a comprehensive list here. Some more notable sources are
