## Inspiration / plagiarism

As with dotfiles everywhere I've begged, borrowed, and stolen snippets from too
many places to provide a comprehensive list here. Some more notable sources are
listed below:

## Requirements

There are a number of requirements I haven't bothered automating their
installation. These include:

 - `git`
 - `tmux`
 - `curl`
 - `python`
 - `python3`
 - `python-pip`
 - `python3-pip`
 - `ruby`
 - `pip`
 - `npm` (`nodejs`)

### Mac OS X

Additional Steps:

 - Install homebrew: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

 - `brew install python3 tmux wget node`
